			<p>Texts from Mittens is a series of text message conversations between a
			snappy, self-absorbed housecat named Mittens and his long-suffering human, 
			a single woman who works away from home during the day. Mittens relentlessly 
			hassles his human all day long, while only taking breaks to watch Judge Judy, hang with his best 
			friend Stumpy, complain about the antics of Drunk Patty the neighbor, ask Grandma for money to buy 
			useless items from QVC, and harass the "filthy beast" dog, Phil.</p>
			<p>Angie Bailey is an award-winning writer and blogger, humorist, and professional member of the Cat 
			Writers' Association. Her primary blog, Catladyland, has won many awards, and her humor writing is 
			featured nearly daily on Catster.com, one of the most popular cat sites on the Web. She loves to 
			photograph her cats in silly poses and sleeps with one eye open. And yes, she has three cats.</p>
			<p>"Texts From Mittens makes me wish my cat had thumbs! This is a hilarious book; Angie Bailey 
			has done it again!"</p>
